The Natural parameterized quantum circuit is a parameterized quantum circuit which has euclidean quantum geometry. That means that the quantum Fisher information metric is the identity for a particular parameter set, which we call the reference parameter. This NPQC is very useful for various applications.

- Training variational quantum algorithms
- Multi-parameter quantum sensing
- Preparation of superposition states


NOTE: Requires older version of qutip, namely <=4.7.5, which has dependencies on older versions of numyp and scipy.
To install, make clean python 3.11 environment and install packages as:
- pip install numpy==1.26.4
- pip install scipy==1.12.0
- pip install qutip==4.7.5
