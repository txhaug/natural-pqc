# Natural parameterized quantum circuit


"Natural parameterized quantum circuit" by T. Haug, M.S. Kim

The Natural parameterized quantum circuit is a parameterized quantum circuit which has euclidean quantum geometry. That means that the quantum Fisher information metric is the identity for a particular parameter set, which we call the reference parameter. This NPQC is very useful for various applications.

- Training variational quantum algorithms
- Multi-parameter quantum sensing
- Preparation of superposition states


The implementation is based on qutip.
